# CollegeStuffs

**Collection of Programming Stuffs in my college life**  

Variety Languages and Programs Incoming as time passes!  

<hr>

Programs are categorized into branches with name as the language  

How do I get these programs ?

```git clone https://github.com/a7r3/CollegeStuffs -b <branch> <dirname>```  

```<branch>``` is the branch name and ```<dirname>``` is the folder under which the programs would be cloned
